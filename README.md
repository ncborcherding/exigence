#### Fix genes from excel

Did I write a function/package just to address the issue with Excel autoconverting genes to date? Yes. 
An estimated 20% of published articles contain these autoconversion errors according [Ziemann et al](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-016-1044-7),
and despite the recent HUGO change in these gene symbols in August 2020, I still have to deal with this issue from collaborators. Thought
I would share if anyone is interested.

### How to use:

```
  file <- read.csv("data.frame) 
  file <- exTerminate(file, gene.Column = NULL, mouse = FALSE) #for genes in row names and human data
  file <- exTerminate(file, gene.Colum = "genes", mouse = TRUE) #for genes in "genes" vector and mouse data
```
